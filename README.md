## 🚀 Key Features

### 💻 Integrated AI Kernel
The "Core Terminal" isn't just a shell—it's powered by the ** AI ** . It acts as the system's sentient kernel, capable of:
- Processing complex technical inquiries.
- Simulating system scans and protocol deployments.
- Providing technical assistance in a concise, cyberpunk-appropriate tone.

### 📊 Real-Time Telemetry
Visual monitoring of vital system signs using advanced data visualization:
- **CPU & RAM Monitoring:** Live AreaChart tracking resource utilization.
- **Network Throughput:** Real-time bandwidth simulation.
- **Uplink Logs:** Monitoring incoming and outgoing signals from simulated external nodes.

### 🗺️ Geo-Tracking & Navigation
- **World Map:** A vector-based holographic map displaying active nodes and unauthorized access alerts.
- **Navigator:** A simulated file explorer to traverse the CyberShell directory structure.

### ⌨️ Virtual Interface
- **On-Screen Keyboard:** A full-scale sci-fi virtual keyboard mimicking the tactile aesthetics of holographic displays.
- **Responsive Grid:** A multi-pane layout optimized for high-resolution displays.
